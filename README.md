Shanghua Gao, a researcher working on computer vision and representation learning.
I am a great fan of open source, as it makes research work valuable for many people.

Some of open source projects that I've been working on/contributing to:
- https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxAgent TxAgent: An AI Agent for Therapeutic Reasoning Across a Universe of Tools （TxAgent = Multi-step reasoning + function calls to 200+ tools）
- https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse ToolUniverse is a collection of biomedical tools designed for AI agents.
- https://github.com/mims-harvard/UniTS (UniTS is a unified time series model that can process various tasks across multiple domains with shared parameters.)
- https://github.com/sail-sg/EditAnything (Aims to Edit and Generate Anything in an image with the help of Segment Anything etc.)
- https://github.com/zhoudaquan/ChatAnything (Facetime Chat with LLM-Enhanced Personas.)
- https://github.com/sail-sg/MDT (Masked Diffusion Transformer is the SOTA for image synthesis.)
- https://github.com/sail-sg/TEC (A very fast and effective self-supervised pretraining method towards sustainable self-supervised learning.)
- https://github.com/LUSSeg (The first method and benchmark for large-scale unsupervised semantic segmentation.)
  [ImageNet-S](https://github.com/LUSSeg/ImageNet-S), [PASS](https://github.com/LUSSeg/PASS), [ImageNetSegModel](https://github.com/LUSSeg/ImageNetSegModel), [LUSS-mmsegmentation](https://github.com/LUSSeg/mmsegmentation)
